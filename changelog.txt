**Changelog:**
__Bot update - ßß3.1.0 - ßßShard Bugfixing and Stuff__
New Stuff:
none

Important Changes:
I will no longer support SFW channels, as Discord gets more strict with content.

Boring Bugfixes:
I had a brainfart with blacklisting "rating:safe" and SFW channels. Caused issues with channels not getting any new posts.
notNull Violation errors, because app attamps adding posts to databse that dont have a artist
shard issues (hopefully) fixed
autopost now checking for channel permissions

Working on, sorted in priority:
Get pool handler for e621 back up and running, was disabled in the update procedure
Add a button to rerun a command
...And alot more (too long for the update message)

**Shameful self promotion:**
Since the bot with all the features is free, I will drop a little self plug right here. ßß>.>
Alongside this popular bot, I also code two other useful bots, that you might like:
- ßß__I-SH__: Have one or multiple partnered servers? With I-SH you can link a channel between them!
- ßß__AgentBlack__: Global user ban and warn bot to keep your server safe!
