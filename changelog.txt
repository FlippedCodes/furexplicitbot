**Changelog:**
__Bot update - ßß3.0.0 - ßßDiscord-App-y-fyed the bot and much more__
⚠️ This build is very new and might have some bugs. If you spot any, please report them to our server in ßß`/about`. Thank you!
New Stuff:
Status Page! Run ßß`/status` to see if a service is down.
New /suggest command, to find your favorite tags and kinks from e621.
Autocomplete for tags ßß(not advised to use on mobile ßß(Blame Discord for bad ßßimplementation), tags can be used without ßßautocomplete)

Important Changes:
ßßAll commands moved to slash commands.
Proper implementation of InkBunny and rule34.
Advanced ßßUwU ßßtalk™ (as you can see... works pretty well).
Source search as been moved to ßßSauceNAO.
Discontinued old prefix ßß'+' --> ßß**You need to use slash commands ßß(/) now!ßß**.
Removed prefix command, as now using slash commands.
Code rewrite for ßßFA (now using a proper ßßdependency).
Lowered command timeout to ßß3 secounds.
Now using ßßFurAffinity-API for better crawling and future command upgrade.

Boring Bugfixes:
Bot was not using public blacklist

Working on, sorted in priority:
Shard the bot, cause many discord servers now
Get pool handler for e621 back up and running, was disabled in the update procedure
Add a button to rerun a command
...And alot more (too long for the update message)

**Shameful self promotion:**
Since the bot with all the features is free, I will drop a little self plug right here. ßß>.>
Alongside this popular bot, I also code two other useful bots, that you might like:
- ßß__I-SH__: Have one or multiple partnered servers? Now you can link a channel between them!
- ßß__AgentBlack__: Global user ban and warn bot to keep your server safe!

This message is only shown once, per user. If you notice any bugs or something's not working properly, feel free to report it on my discord server. Link is in ßß/about. ^^
