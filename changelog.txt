Boring Bug Fixes:
Blacklisted tags for autoposts no longer get stored permanantly in a DB entry

Working on, sorted in priority:
Kinkfinder aka favorite tags finder
Add a button to rerun a command
Shard the bot, cause many discord servers now
Add a autopost for ßßfuraffinity for new posts from a artist
Add a detailed view for ßßfuraffinity

**Shameful self promotion:**
Since the bot with all the features is free, I will drop a little self plug right here.
Alongside this popular bot, I also code two other useful bots, that you might like:
- ßß__I-SH__: Have one or multiple partnered servers? Now you can link a channel between them!
- ßß__AgentBlack__: Global user ban and warn bot to keep your server safe!

This message is only shown once, per user. If you notice any bugs or something's not working properly, feel free to report it on my discord server. Link is in ßß/about. ^^
