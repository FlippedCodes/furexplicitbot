**Thanks to everyone using my bot. I would have never thought reaching 400+ server milestone in a year~ While life has been busy I hope to pic back up the development of the bot to bring you new features.**

__If you added the bot before 15.01.2021, make sure you allow "manage messages" permissions for the bot. This allows for better usage with the pool feature and the new rate limitation for reactions.__
__Please add the permission manually, because re-adding the bot to your server will delete your bot configuration (Prefix, Autopost, ...)__

**Changelog:**
__New Stuff__
+ pool support for e621 (might still not work perfectly)
+ added timeout to reaction usage to comply with e621 rate limits
+ added more uwu talk

__Important Changes__
* renamed "tags" in "general tags" in e621 detail-embed
* allowed wildcard autoposts

__Boring Bugfixes__
* preventing re-use of show all details on e621 if the reaction has been already pressed
* prune e621 autopost-cache when blacklist gets updated to force changes
* postcache artist couldn't be null, causing errors in the log, now fixed
* reaction removal from old posts used to cause massive log errors: now checking if permissions are in place
* updated all packages
* code cleanup

__Working on__
code rewrite for FA
code rewrite for r34
code rewrite for IB
whitelist/blacklist (not sure yet) tags in certain channels
user suggestion: default tags for e621 commands (originally: required score)
add furrynetwork command
user suggestion: add nhentai command
(add sofurry command)
(autodetect source)
