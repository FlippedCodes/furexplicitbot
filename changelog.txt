Working on, sorted in priority:

...And alot more (too long for the update message)

**Shameful self promotion:**
Since the bot with all the features is free, I will drop a little self plug right here. ßß>.>
Alongside this popular bot, I also code two other useful bots, that you might like:
- ßß__I-SH__: Have one or multiple partnered servers? With I-SH you can link a channel between them!
- ßß__AgentBlack__: Global user ban and warn bot to keep your server safe!
