**Changelog:**
__Bot update - ßß3.0.0 - ßßDiscord-App-y-fyed the bot__
New Stuff:
Status Page! Run ßß`/status` to see if a service is down.
FurAffintiy can now be used in SFW channels as well! (SFW results).
New /suggest command, to find your favorite tags and picutures from e621.

Important Changes:
ßßAll commands moved to slash commands.
Advanced ßßUwU ßßtalk™ (as you can see... works pretty well).
Source search as been moved to ßßSauceNAO.
Discontinued old prefix ßß'+' --> ßß**You need to use slash commands ßß(/) now!ßß**.
Removed prefix command, as now using slash commands.
Code rewrite for ßßFA (now using a proper ßßdependency).
Lowered command timeout to ßß3 secounds.
Now using ßßFurAffinity-API for better crawling and future command upgrade.

Boring Bug Fixes:
ONGOING: the search function of FA is currently not woring due to an issue in the new dependency.
Blacklisted tags for autoposts no longer get stored permanantly in a DB entry.

Working on, sorted in priority:
Kinkfinder aka favorite tags finder
Add a button to rerun a command
Shard the bot, cause many discord servers now
Add a autopost for ßßfuraffinity for new posts from a artist
Add a detailed view for ßßfuraffinity
...And alot more (too long for the update message)

**Shameful self promotion:**
Since the bot with all the features is free, I will drop a little self plug right here.
Alongside this popular bot, I also code two other useful bots, that you might like:
- ßß__I-SH__: Have one or multiple partnered servers? Now you can link a channel between them!
- ßß__AgentBlack__: Global user ban and warn bot to keep your server safe!

This message is only shown once, per user. If you notice any bugs or something's not working properly, feel free to report it on my discord server. Link is in ßß/about. ^^
