**Shameful self promotion:**
Sice the bot with all the features is free I will drop a little self plug right here:
Alongside this popular bot, I also code other useful bots.



**Changelog:**
__Bot update - 3.0.0 - Discord-App-y-fyed the bot__
New Stuff:
Status Page! Run `/status` to see if a service is down.

Important Changes:
All commands moved to slash commands
Advanced UwU talkâ„¢
Source search as been moved to SauceNAO

Boring Bug Fixes:
* Blacklisted tags for autoposts no longer get stored permanantly in a DB entry

Working on/Plans/Ideas:
Shard the bot, cause many discord servers now
code rewrite for FA
code rewrite for r34
code rewrite for IB
whitelist(/blacklist) tags in certain channels
user suggestion: default tags for e621 commands (originally: required score)
add furrynetwork command
user suggestion: add nhentai command
get artist/tag art from FA or e621
better Booru API handler and register custom Imageboards
RP finder and OC information handler
(add sofurry command)
(add E-Hentai command)
(user suggestion: add FurryBurru command)
(autodetect source - problemetic with API usage rates in SauceNAO)
