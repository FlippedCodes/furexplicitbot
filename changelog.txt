**Shameful self promotion:**
Since the bot with all the features is free, I will drop a little self plug right here.
Alongside this popular bot, I also code two other useful bots, that you might like:
- ßß__I-SH__: Have one or multiple partnered servers? Now you can link a channel between them!
- ßß__AgentBlack__: Global user ban and warn bot to keep your server safe!

This message is only shown once, per user. If you notice any bugs or something's not working properly, feel free to report it on my discord server. Link is in ßß/about. ^^
